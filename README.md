# space_sleeve

The Space Sleeve is a stylish exoskeleton that takes the place of an astronautâ€™s forearm section of their space suit. It will be used during missions in space/spacewalks, providing all the information necessary for the user to monitor their own suit and health conditions while completing the mission objectives with their teammates.

The Space Sleeve code hosted here contains backend logic to glean data from the Sleeve's sensors and the GUI elements to display it on-screen.
